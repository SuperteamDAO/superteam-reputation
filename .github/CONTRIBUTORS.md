## Development Guidelines

It is a basic [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) project with [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/getting-started) as component library. We are using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/motivation)  as package manager. You will have to install node.js before running this project locally.
